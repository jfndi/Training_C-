# Training_C++
Just some exercises and challenges to stay fit.
For the challenges (At least the HackerRanck ones), my code is made public under the MIT license.
That being said, if you intend to go the HackerRank way, I strongly recommend that you REALLY try
to solve the challenges on your own. If you have great problems with some (passing HakkerRank test
cases is not a guarantee to see your solution being accepted, I have been there), then take a look
at the proposed solution, work on it, understand it and find your own way to resolve based on this
new information. Believe me, it does worth the pain.

Regarding the statement of HackerRank challenges, you can find them [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
Select C++ in the dashboard and here you are. Sign up is free for developers.
